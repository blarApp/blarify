### PR #242: Fix workflow discovery DFS path sequencing gaps

#### What I Learned
- Bridge edge pattern addresses DFS path sequencing gaps by creating synthetic connections between consecutive paths
- _create_bridge_edges() maintains database integrity by creating edges only in memory (never stored)
- Bridge edges have identical structure to CALLS edges for uniform LLM processing
- Path boundary detection uses depth=0 and entry point ID reoccurrence to identify new DFS paths
- Step ordering is crucial for continuous execution trace reconstruction

#### Patterns to Watch
- Bridge edges should always have call_line=None and call_character=None since they're synthetic
- Functions creating synthetic data should be prefixed with underscore (_create_bridge_edges)
- Complex query functions should be split into query generation and execution components
- Integration tests should verify compatibility with existing data structures (WorkflowResult)
- Bridge edge creation is O(n) complexity and scales linearly with path count

#### Architecture Insights
- DFS traversal creates independent paths that need synthetic connections for continuity
- LLM agents require continuous execution traces for complete workflow understanding
- Database integrity preserved by keeping synthetic data in memory only
- Step ordering provides the sequence needed for timeline reconstruction

# GitHub Integration Node-Based Blame Implementation

## Title and Overview

**Enhanced GitHub Integration Using Node-Based Blame Approach**

This prompt guides the implementation of an enhanced GitHub integration layer that uses a node-based blame approach to accurately track which commits and PRs affected specific code nodes. Instead of fetching the N latest PRs, this implementation receives existing nodes and uses GitHub's GraphQL API blame functionality to identify all commits that touched those specific lines, providing more accurate and efficient integration.

### Context

Blarify is a codebase analysis tool that converts code repositories into graph structures stored in Neo4j/FalkorDB. The current GitHub integration fetches latest PRs and attempts to map them to code. This new approach inverts the process: starting with existing code nodes, it uses GitHub's blame API to find exactly which commits modified those nodes, then traces back to the associated PRs.

## Problem Statement

### Current Limitations

1. **Inaccurate Mapping**: The current PR-first approach may miss commits that don't have associated PRs or incorrectly map changes to code nodes
2. **Inefficient Processing**: Fetching all recent PRs and their commits is wasteful when we only care about specific code areas
3. **Line-Level Precision**: Current patch parsing approach lacks the precision of GitHub's blame functionality
4. **Missing Historical Context**: Cannot easily trace the complete history of changes to a specific function or class

### Impact on Users

- **Developers** get more accurate attribution of who changed specific code and when
- **Code Reviewers** can trace exact commit history for any code node
- **Engineering Managers** gain precise insights into code ownership and change patterns
- **Analysis Tools** can provide accurate blame information for any line range

### Business Impact

This implementation enables:
- Precise code ownership tracking at the line level
- Accurate historical analysis of code evolution
- Efficient querying for specific code areas without processing unnecessary data
- Foundation for advanced features like code churn analysis and contributor metrics

## Feature Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Node-Based Processing**
   - Accept a list of existing code nodes (files, functions, classes)
   - Query GitHub blame API for exact line ranges of each node
   - Retrieve all commits that touched those specific lines
   - Trace commits back to their associated PRs

2. **GitHub GraphQL Integration**
   - Use GraphQL API for efficient blame queries
   - Support batching multiple blame requests
   - Handle pagination for large blame ranges
   - Optimize query patterns for performance

3. **Blame-Based Commit Discovery**
   - For each node, get file path and line range
   - Query blame for that exact range at current HEAD
   - Extract unique commits from blame results
   - Fetch full commit details including associated PRs

4. **Graph Integration**
   - Create IntegrationNode objects for discovered PRs and commits
   - Establish MODIFIED_BY relationships with exact line attribution
   - Support PR → INTEGRATION_SEQUENCE → Commits relationships
   - Maintain all existing relationship patterns

### Technical Requirements

1. **GraphQL Implementation**
   - Implement GitHub GraphQL client alongside REST API
   - Use blame field for precise line-level attribution
   - Batch queries efficiently to minimize API calls
   - Handle GraphQL-specific error scenarios

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Cache blame results to avoid duplicate queries
   - Batch node processing for efficiency
   - Use GraphQL to minimize round trips
   - Implement smart pagination strategies

3. **Accuracy Guarantees**
   - Ensure exact line range matching
   - Handle renamed/moved files correctly
   - Track changes across file history
   - Validate blame results against node boundaries

### Integration Points

1. **Existing Systems**
   - Integrate with current GitHubCreator patterns
   - Maintain compatibility with existing relationships
   - Use established database manager interfaces
   - Follow existing IntegrationNode structure

2. **GraphQL Dependencies**
   - GitHub GraphQL API v4
   - Authentication via personal access tokens
   - Rate limiting with GraphQL point system
   - Efficient query construction

## Technical Analysis

### Current Implementation Review

**Existing Approach:**
- GitHubCreator fetches N latest PRs from repository
- For each PR, fetches associated commits
- For each commit, fetches file changes
- Attempts to map file changes to existing code nodes using patch parsing
- Creates MODIFIED_BY relationships based on line overlap

**Limitations:**
- May process many irrelevant PRs/commits
- Patch parsing is complex and error-prone
- Cannot handle commits without PRs
- Inefficient for targeted analysis

### Proposed Technical Approach

**Node-Based Blame Approach:**
```
Code Node (existing)
  ↓ [extract file path and line range]
GitHub Blame Query (GraphQL)
  ↓ [returns commits for exact lines]
Commit Nodes (create if not exists)
  ← [MODIFIED_BY with exact line attribution]
  ↓ [fetch associated PRs]
PR Nodes (create if not exists)
  ↓ [INTEGRATION_SEQUENCE]
Commit Nodes
```

**GraphQL Query Pattern:**
```graphql
query ($owner:String!, $name:String!, $expr:String!, $start:Int!, $end:Int!) {
  repository(owner:$owner, name:$name) {
    object(expression: $expr) {
      ... on Blob {
        blame(range: {startLine: $start, endLine: $end}) {
          ranges {
            startingLine
            endingLine
            age
            commit {
              oid
              committedDate
              message
              additions
              deletions
              author {
                name
                email
                user { login }
              }
              committer {
                name
                email
                user { login }
              }
              url
              associatedPullRequests(first: 1) {
                nodes {
                  number
                  title
                  url
                  author { login }
                  mergedAt
                  state
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Dual API Support**: Maintain REST API for basic operations, add GraphQL for blame queries
2. **Incremental Processing**: Process nodes in batches to manage API rate limits
3. **Caching Strategy**: Cache blame results by file+commit SHA to avoid duplicate queries
4. **Relationship Precision**: Store exact line ranges in MODIFIED_BY relationships

### Dependencies and Integration Points

**New Dependencies:**
- GraphQL client library (or use requests with GraphQL endpoint)
- Query construction utilities
- Response parsing for nested GraphQL structures

**Integration with Existing Code:**
- Extend GitHub class with GraphQL methods
- Add blame_commits_for_range method
- Enhance GitHubCreator with node-based processing
- Maintain backward compatibility

**PR Title:** `feat: Enhanced GitHub integration with node-based blame approach`

**PR Description:**
```markdown
## Overview
Implements enhanced GitHub integration using node-based blame queries for precise commit and PR attribution.

## Key Improvements
- ✅ **Accuracy**: Exact line-level attribution using GitHub blame API
- ✅ **Efficiency**: Reduces API calls by >50% compared to PR-first approach
- ✅ **Precision**: Only processes commits that actually touched code nodes
- ✅ **Performance**: Smart caching and batch processing optimizations

## Technical Changes
- Added GraphQL client support to GitHub class
- Implemented blame_commits_for_range method
- Enhanced GitHubCreator with node-based processing
- Added exact line attribution to MODIFIED_BY relationships
- Maintained full backward compatibility

## GraphQL Query Pattern
```graphql
query ($owner:String!, $name:String!, $expr:String!, $start:Int!, $end:Int!) {
  repository(owner:$owner, name:$name) {
    object(expression: $expr) {
      ... on Blob {
        blame(range: {startLine: $start, endLine: $end}) {
          ranges {
            commit { ... }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples
```python
# Node-based processing (new approach)
creator = GitHubCreator(...)
nodes = db_manager.query("MATCH (n:FUNCTION) RETURN n")
result = creator.create_github_integration_from_nodes(nodes)

# Backward compatible PR-first approach
result = creator.create_github_integration_from_latest_prs(pr_limit=50)

## Query Examples

### Find Commits That Modified Specific Lines
```cypher
-- Find commits that modified lines 10-50 of a function
MATCH (f:FUNCTION {name: "authenticate"})-[r:MODIFIED_BY]->(c:INTEGRATION)
WHERE c.source_type = "commit"
  AND r.attribution_method = "blame"
  AND r.blamed_lines CONTAINS '{"start": 10, "end": 50}'
RETURN c.message, c.author, c.timestamp, r.blamed_lines
```

### Find Exact Line Attribution
```cypher
-- Get exact lines each commit modified in a file
MATCH (f:FILE {path: "src/main.py"})-[r:MODIFIED_BY]->(c:INTEGRATION)
WHERE r.attribution_method = "blame"
RETURN c.sha, c.message, r.blamed_lines, r.total_lines_affected
ORDER BY c.timestamp DESC
```

### Find Code Ownership
```cypher
-- Find who last modified each function
MATCH (f:FUNCTION)-[r:MODIFIED_BY]->(c:INTEGRATION)
WHERE r.attribution_method = "blame"
WITH f, c, r
ORDER BY c.timestamp DESC
WITH f, COLLECT({
  author: c.author,
  timestamp: c.timestamp,
  lines: r.blamed_lines
})[0] as last_change
RETURN f.name, last_change.author as owner, last_change.timestamp as last_modified
```

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Blame Features

1. **Historical Blame**
   - Blame at specific commits/tags
   - Track code movement across files
   - Handle file renames and refactoring

2. **Incremental Updates**
   - Only re-blame changed files
   - Webhook-triggered updates
   - Smart cache invalidation

3. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Code churn metrics per developer
   - Ownership percentage calculations
   - Hot spot identification

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Parallel Processing**
   - Concurrent GraphQL queries
   - Async batch processing
   - Worker pool for large repositories

2. **Smart Caching**
   - Persistent cache storage
   - Cache warming strategies
   - Distributed cache support

This enhanced GitHub integration provides superior accuracy and efficiency compared to the PR-first approach, enabling precise code attribution and ownership tracking while maintaining full backward compatibility and improving performance.
